description: ESRI Bare Earth project is geospatial masterpiece

Some amazing, interactive lidar images were posted [here](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/30/show-with-the-flow-elevation-maps-reveal-world-rivers) in The Guardian yesterday. The article appears to be a promo for ESRI UK, but who cares? Scroll to the Rio Negro at the bottom of the page and drag the slider all the way to the right.

I browsed the ESRI website to hunt down some more. I found this stunning section named [Bare Earth](https://wadnr.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.html?appid=36b4887370d141fcbb35392f996c82d9)—a masterpiece of beautiful web design accompanied with museum-quality content explaining the workings of lidar and the intricate natural footprints it exposes. Tab over to “Rivers” and marvel at an x-ray of the Sauk as vegetation is stripped away, revealing a million years of hydro-geomorphologic history.
