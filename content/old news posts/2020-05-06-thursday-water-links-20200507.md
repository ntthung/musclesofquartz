#### 1. Researchers at Rice claim to have created efficient means to producing hydrogen from sunlight and water

> *This sort of catalysis isnâ€™t new, but the lab packaged a perovskite layer and the electrodes into a single module that, when dropped into water and placed in sunlight, produces hydrogen with no further input.*

Summary article [here](https://www.futurity.org/water-splitting-machine-artificial-leaf-hydrogen-fuel-2356252/).
Paper in ACS Nano, [here](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.9b09053).

#### 2. More hype on water harvesting from air

> *Michael Mirilashvili wants to deliver hundreds of generators that produce drinking water out of thin air. His company, Watergen, sent a machine to a Gaza hospital last week in a rare case of Israeli-Palestinian cooperation in the Hamas-ruled enclave.*

Article in Yahoo News, [here](https://news.yahoo.com/israeli-billionaire-hopes-bring-water-085118169.html). There has been a lot of media hype on air moisture harvesting recently. I'd like to see a rigorous academic study on the efficiencies, costs, etc. Is this really a viable water supply technology for poor, drought-stricken regions?

#### 3. Cloud seeding in North Korea

> *After years of devastating droughts that led to food shortages in North Korea, scientists in the Hermit Kingdom reportedly started developing artificial rain to combat the problem... On Wednesday, a report by South Korean news outlet NK Economy said that scientists at North Korea's Kim Il Sung University have been developing such artificial rainfall for years to fight drought.*

Article in [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/world/north-korea-testing-cloud-seeding-making-it-rain-after-devastating-droughts-weather).

As noted in [this post](https://www.musclesofquartz.com/post/does-cloud-seeding-actually-work/) from a few weeks back, the effectiveness of cloud seeding is seemly still poorly understood.
