Here’s a list of my favorite water blogs.

- [Tony Ladson](https://tonyladson.wordpress.com). Excellent technical resource with regular posts on the mathematical, statistical, and computational aspects of hydrology.
- [AboutHydrology](http://abouthydrology.blogspot.com). The blog of Riccardo Rigon. Features a popular and regularly-updated list of R tools for hydrology. Also features videos, technical resources, and some really interesting musings on the science of hydrology and hydrological modeling.
- [Joe’s Water Blog](http://www.joeswaterblog.com/). An informative and passionately-written blog. It’s politically-motivated and argues convincingly for the introduction of water pricing in Ireland. Also features interesting articles on water issues globally.
- [Hydrology on Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hydrology/). Not exactly a blog; more of a forum. Very popular. Lots of fresh posts. Plenty of interaction from the global community of hydrologists. Well worth adding to your bookmarks and checking regularly.
- [HEPEX](https://hepex.irstea.fr). Very passionate and active group of researchers focused on hydrological forecasting. A great community. Interesting posts appear regularly.
- [Water Programming blog from the Reed group](https://waterprogramming.wordpress.com). Essential reading for folks immersed in the world of water resources systems modeling and optimization.
- [Maven’s Notebook](https://mavensnotebook.com). Insane flow of information on California water resources.
- [Anne Jefferson](http://all-geo.org/jefferson/blog/). Just discovered this very nice pure hydrology blog. Look forward to following Anne’s posts more closely.

Others that I intend to check in on from time to time:
- [UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology blog](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/blog).
- [On The Public Record](https://onthepublicrecord.org).
- [IWA](https://iwa-network.org/blog/).
- [A blog about Scottish snow](https://scottishsnow.wordpress.com) (!!)

Water blogging is alive and well. Please comment below if I missed any good ones, including blogs in languages other than English.
