It was only going to be a matter of time before water and sewage services hit the headlines in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak. How about this:

> just one in five water departments have explicitly agreed to reconnect households currently without running water. The rest have only committed to halting new shutoffs.

Article in The Guardian [here](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/90-us-cities-and-states-suspend-water-shutoffs-to-tackle-coronavirus-pandemic). In short, water suppliers in the US (and in many other countries) shut off water to folks that don’t pay their bills. They’re going to stop doing that given the COVID-19 outbreak. But most utilities won’t commit to reconnecting folks that currently lack water supply. My guess is that utilities are pretty stretched right now and that reconnections are a significant manpower burden.

What caught my attention here is the staggering proportion of households in the US that currently lack basic running water. According to [this](https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/sites/default/files/rpt_1810_watershutoffs-web2.pdf) 2018 report by Food and Water Watch:

> The average water utility shut off 5 percent of households for nonpayment in 2016.

…and…

>  The highest water shutoff rates were in Oklahoma, where Oklahoma City and Tulsa disconnected one in five households for nonpayment. Three cities —Eau Claire, Wisconsin; Leominster, Massachusetts; and Champlain Water District, Vermont — did not shut off any household for nonpayment.

We can surmise that there are currently a lot of Americans without basic hand washing facilities at home.
