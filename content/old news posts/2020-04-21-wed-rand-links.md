A break from the drought specials today.

Instead, some interesting new articles:

#### 1 [Hedging is working on the CRB](https://www.azpm.org/p/home-articles-news/2020/4/18/170439-report-arizonas-colorado-river-water-supply-will-hold-steady-next-year/)

> *Under the drought contingency plan hammered out by Colorado River Basin states last year, Arizona agreed to voluntarily reduce its water use by 192,000 acre-feet, or about 7%, leaving that water in Lake Mead to help reduce the likelihood of greater cutbacks down the road. Tom Buschatzke, director of the Arizona Department of Water Resources, says data from a new Bureau of Reclamation report show that plan is working.*

#### 2 [Approval for new reservoir to offset demands on Lake Okeechobee](https://floridapolitics.com/archives/328897-army-corps-permit-eaa-reservoir)

> *"Now that the South Florida Water Management District has received its final federal permit to begin work at the site, it is my hope that we move quickly on construction of this vital piece of the puzzle for Everglades restoration. The EAA Reservoir will enable water storage south of Lake Okeechobee and reduce discharges to the Caloosahatchee River. The beginning of this project is great news for anyone concerned about our water quality, as the effects of improving the Reservoir will cut down on the harmful algal blooms we currently experience."*
