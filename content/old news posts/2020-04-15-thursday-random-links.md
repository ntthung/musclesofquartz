#### 1. America’s most endangered Rivers.

[The annual America’s Most Endangered Rivers® report](https://s3.amazonaws.com/american-rivers-website/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/14101629/American-Rivers_Most-Endangered-Rivers-2020-report_WEB-4.pdf) has just been published. The report offer’s the environmental conservationist group’s assessment of the ten most threatened American rivers, based on three criteria:

Topicality: Is a major decision imminent in the coming year?

Significance: How important is the river for people and ecosystems?

Magnitude: How big is the threat.

It’s quite a subjective assessment, but interesting nonetheless to understand the perspectives of a hardcode conservationist group.

The top five most threatened rivers: (1) Upper Mississippi, (2) Lower Mississippi, (3) Big Sunflower River,  Mississippi, (4) Puyallup River, Washington,, and (5) South Fork Salmon River, Idaho.

The report is summarized [here](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/portions-of-mississippi-and-missouri-rivers-are-most-endangered-in-u-s/) in Scientific American.


#### 2. Dam removal in Northern California

> *The plan – the largest dam removal project in the US – would re-open 360 miles of the Klamath River and its tributaries to salmon.*

#### 3. "It was at least two acres, almost two football pitches"

> *A huge floating island in Lake Victoria triggered a nationwide blackout in Uganda after clogging a turbine in a hydroelectric power station.*

The story ([here on the BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-52286296)) is as fun as it sounds.
