**Me:** Sean Turner. Hydrologist / water resources modeler at the Pacific Northwest National Lab. Self-proclaimed water infovore.

**This blog:** Daily updates and occasional commentary on new material coming from science journals, news media, Governmental and non-governmental organizations, and my favorite water blogs. I post whatever I think is interesting and insightful.

**Why "Muscles of Quartz"?** Check out Pablo Neruda's wonderful poem "Entrance of the River". I stole it from there. And please let me know if there's a better poem of peice of literature out there that describes hydrological processes so beautifully!!
