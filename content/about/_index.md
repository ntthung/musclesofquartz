**Me:** Sean Turner. Water resources systems analyst based in the Pacific Northwest.

**This blog:** Here you'll find regular tutorials for scraping, wrangling, and analyzing water resources data using R.

**Why "Muscles of Quartz"?** Check out "Entrance of the Rivers" by Pablo Neruda. It's the only piece of acclaimed world literature I'm aware of that describes hydrological processes.
