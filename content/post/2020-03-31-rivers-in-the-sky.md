Two new papers help the layman hydrologist catch up on the flourishing science of atmosheric rivers.

The first is a superb review by Ashley Payne and colleagues, published [here](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/BAMS-D-19-0348.1?af=R) in Nature Earth and Environment. If you want a primer on atmospheric rivers, this is for you. It’s wonderfully written and jammed with data.

How about this for an opener:

> *Atmospheric rivers are synoptic-scale features characterized by their striking geometry—extending thousands of kilometres in length and an order of magnitude less in width—and vertically coherent low-level moisture transport concentrated in the bottom 3km of the atmosphere.*

So why are atmospheric rivers important?

> *ARs provide 20–30% of annual precipitation in western Europe and the western USA, and 14–44% of warm-season total precipitation in East Asia.*

> *ARs contribute approximately 22% of the global run-off, reaching 50% in certain regions*

> *The impacts of ARs are not limited to riverine flooding; 40–60% of annual sea-level maxima at several sites along the West Coast were also connected to AR storm events*

> *…in regions currently frequented by ARs, the recurrence of droughts would increase by up to 90% in the absence of ARs, due to both the immediate precipitation responses and the longer-term persistence of soil moisture after the event itself*

(There’s much, much more in the paper).

Then yesterday the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society (BAMS) published some notes from an expert panel discussing the [Atmospheric River Tracking Intercomparison Project (ARTMIP)](http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/projects/artmip/). ARTMIP aims to gather and formalize the various methods of tracking atmospheric rivers. This is much less accessible than the Payne et al. review paper, but reading it gives one a sense of the sophistication and maturity of this burgeoning science.
