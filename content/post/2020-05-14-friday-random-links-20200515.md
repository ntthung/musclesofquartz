#### 2. [Dam filling agreement stalled](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/05/sudan-rejects-ethiopia-proposal-sign-nile-mega-dam-agreement-200513065649833.html)

> *Sudan has rejected an Ethiopian proposal to sign an initial agreement greenlighting the filling of a controversial mega-dam, calling its neighbour to resume the stalled United States-brokered negotiations on the issue.*

Some background:

> *Tensions have been high in the Nile basin ever since Ethiopia broke ground on the project in 2011. Bellicose rhetoric, including the Ethiopian prime ministerâ€™s warnings of possible military action last year, have turned the dam into an explosive issue. Ethiopia says the dam is crucial for its economy, while Egypt fears it will disrupt the river that provides almost all of its water. Sudan hopes the dam will provide much-needed electricity and help regulate flooding.*
