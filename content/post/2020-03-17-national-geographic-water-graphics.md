Today I discovered the amazing collection of graphics in the National Geographic Resource Library (thanks to [Homesanto](https://www.reddit.com/user/Homesanto/) posting in Reddit Hydrology). The graphics are marketed at kids, but theyâ€™re splendid examples of geospatial data visualization.

Some favorites below. Use liberally in your power point presentations and teaching materials.
