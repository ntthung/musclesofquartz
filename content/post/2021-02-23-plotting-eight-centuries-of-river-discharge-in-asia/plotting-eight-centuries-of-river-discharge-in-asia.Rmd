# Introduction

Figure 1 below is a complex plot, with multiple panels and annotations, that was created fully in R. Initially, I made the main figure in R and annotated it in Adobe Acrobat. But soon I got tired of re-annotating the figure every time I revised it. So I put in some effort to make the whole plot completely reproducible. In this post, I will detail the steps to create this figure. Rather than showing just the good working code, I will try to describe some of my thinking process to show how the plot developed through trial and error.

![**Figure 1**. Eight centuries of river discharge history in Asia. Panel a shows the standardized streamflow index (SSI, the z-score of the annual discharge) at 62 rivers in Asia. Negative SSI values correspond to low flow (dry conditions) and positive SSI values denote high flow (wet conditions). The rivers are divided into six regions: CA (Central Asia), EA (East Asia), CN (eastern China), WA (West Asia), SEA (Southeast Asia), and SA (South Asia). Panel b shows the SSI in nine historical events: (1) the Samalas eruption, (2) and (3) the Angkor Droughts I and II, (4) the Kuwae eruption, (5) the Ming Dynasty Drought, (6) the Strange Parallel Drought, (7) the East India Drought, (8) the Tambora eruption, and (9) the Victorian Great Drought. Refer to [@nguyen2020] for more details.](asia-flow-full-plot.png){style="text align: center"}

The stations' locations are provided in Figure 2.

# Data

The data are provided in the GitHub repo of this blog. Let's read the file and have an overview of the data.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(data.table)
ssi <- fread('asia-standardiized-streamflow-index.csv', key = 'ID')
ssi
```

The data already come in the tidy format, so that's great.

```{r}
range(ssi$ssi)
```

I've also provided the metadata for the stations. Let's take a look.

```{r}
meta <- fread('station-meta.csv', key = 'ID')
head(meta, 10)
```

# Plotting panel a

First, let's plot the basic heat map.

```{r, fig.height=7, fig.width=8}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(ssi) +
  geom_raster(aes(year, ID, fill = ssi)) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    name = NULL,
    breaks = seq(1200, 2000, 50), 
    expand = c(0, 0), 
    position = 'top') +
  scale_y_discrete(name = 'Streamflow station', expand = c(0, 0)) +
  scale_fill_gradient2(
    name = 'Standardized streamflow index', 
    low = '#6b473e', mid = 'snow1', high = '#125a0d', 
    breaks = -3:3,
    limits = c(-3.7, 3.7)) +
  theme(
    legend.key.width = unit(1, 'cm'),
    legend.key.height = unit(0.3, 'cm'),
    legend.justification = 'left',
    legend.position = 'top',
    axis.line.x = element_line())
```

The heat map looks good. However, the stations are arranged by alphabetical order, which is not what we want. They should be arranged by region, and from South to North in each region (South to North rather than North to South because when plotting, the y-axis goes up). So the next step is to arrange the stations using their metadata.

```{r}
# First, we arrange the regions from South to North
meta[, region := factor(region, c('SA', 'SEA', 'WA', 'CN', 'EA', 'CA'))]
# Now we sort by region and lattitude
meta <- meta[order(region, lat)]
# Now we create a column code to encode the plotting order
meta[, plotOrder := 1:.N]
# Let's insepct the updated meta, showing only the columns of interest
meta[, .(ID, region, lat, plotOrder)]
```

Let's merge the data now so that we can rearrange the stations in the plot.

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=7}
ssi2 <- merge(ssi, meta[, .(ID, region, plotOrder)], by = 'ID')
ggplot(ssi2) +
  geom_raster(aes(year, plotOrder, fill = ssi)) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    name = NULL, 
    breaks = seq(1200, 2000, 50),
    expand = c(0, 0), 
    position = 'top') +
  scale_y_continuous(name = 'Streamflow station', expand = c(0, 0)) +
  scale_fill_gradient2(
    name = 'Standardized streamflow index', 
    low = '#6b473e', mid = 'snow1', high = '#125a0d', 
    breaks = -3:3,
    limits = c(-3.7, 3.7)) +
  theme(
    legend.key.width = unit(1, 'cm'),
    legend.key.height = unit(0.3, 'cm'),
    legend.justification = 'left',
    legend.position = 'top',
    axis.line.x = element_line())
```

Now the stations are in order. The next step is to plot the region delination lines, hide away the order number, and annotate with the region names instead. To do so, we need to determine the vertical locations of the region lines and texts.

```{r}
# Determine the number of stations in each region
regions <- meta[, .(count = .N), by = region]
# Starting point for lines. Each cell has size 1x1,
# therefore we add 0.5 so that the lines are at the top of the cells.
regions[1, top := count + 0.5]
for (i in 2:nrow(regions)) regions$top[i] <- regions$top[i-1] + regions$count[i]
# Midpoints for annotation
regions[, mid := top - count / 2]
```

We can now plot with annotations.

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=4}
ggplot(ssi2) +
  geom_raster(aes(year, plotOrder, fill = ssi)) +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = top), regions, colour = 'grey50') +
  annotate(
    'text',
    x = 1150, 
    y = regions$mid, 
    label = regions$region,
    hjust = 0) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    name = NULL, 
    breaks = seq(1200, 2000, 50),
    expand = c(0, 0), 
    position = 'top') +
  scale_y_continuous(name = 'Streamflow station', expand = c(0, 0)) +
  scale_fill_gradient2(
    name = 'Standardized streamflow index', 
    low = '#6b473e', mid = 'snow1', high = '#125a0d', 
    breaks = -3:3,
    limits = c(-3.7, 3.7)) +
  theme(
    panel.background = element_blank(),
    legend.key.width = unit(1, 'cm'),
    legend.key.height = unit(0.3, 'cm'),
    legend.justification = 'left',
    legend.position = 'top',
    axis.line.x = element_line(),
    axis.text.y = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.y = element_blank()) 
```

Now the region lines and the texts are where they need to be, but the lines extend too far to the left. We extended the x-axis back to the year 1150 so that we could plot the region texts, and we used `geom_hline()`, which draws lines throughout the plot. We could fix this by changing from `geom_hline()` to `geom_linerange()` and providing additional `xmax` and `xmin` arguments. I tried this and realized that this didn't work because the x-axis still extended back and that looked ugly. Then I came up with a new trick: I'll make use of the axis breaks for the region texts. This way, I don't have to extend the x-axis back, and I don't have to add a new layer.

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=4}
ggplot(ssi2) +
  geom_raster(aes(year, plotOrder, fill = ssi)) +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = top), regions, colour = 'grey50') +
  scale_x_continuous(
    name = NULL, 
    breaks = seq(1200, 2000, 50),
    expand = c(0, 0), 
    position = 'top') +
  scale_y_continuous(
    name = 'Streamflow station', 
    breaks = regions$mid,
    labels = regions$region,
    expand = c(0, 0)) +
  scale_fill_gradient2(
    name = 'Standardized streamflow index', 
    low = '#6b473e', mid = 'snow1', high = '#125a0d', 
    breaks = -3:3,
    limits = c(-3.7, 3.7)) +
  theme(
    panel.background = element_blank(),
    legend.key.width = unit(1, 'cm'),
    legend.key.height = unit(0.3, 'cm'),
    legend.justification = 'left',
    legend.position = 'top',
    axis.line.x = element_line(),
    # the line axis.text.y = element_blank() is removed
    axis.ticks.y = element_blank()) 
```

Hooray!

# Plotting panel b

Panel b consists of subsets of panel a for different periods. Thus we can transform the code of panel a into a function that takes the starting and ending years and just plots the heatmap for that period. Additionally, we need to take care of the axes: panel a's x-axis is on top while those of panel b is at the bottom, and the x-axis has custom breaks. Only the first subpanel of b has the region texts. Only panel a has the legend. These options can be handled easily by function aruguments.

## Plotting routine

```{r}
flow_history <- function(ssi.data, 
                         region.data, 
                         start.year, 
                         end.year,
                         legend.position = c('top', 'none'),
                         x.breaks,
                         x.axis.position = c('bottom', 'top'),
                         region.text = FALSE) {
  ggplot(ssi.data[year %between% c(start.year, end.year)]) +
    geom_raster(aes(year, plotOrder, fill = ssi)) +
    geom_hline(aes(yintercept = top), region.data, colour = 'grey50') +
    scale_x_continuous(
      name = NULL,
      breaks = x.breaks,
      expand = c(0, 0), 
      position = x.axis.position) +
    scale_y_continuous(
      name = 'Streamflow station', 
      breaks = region.data$mid,
      labels = region.data$region,
      expand = c(0, 0)) +
    scale_fill_gradient2(
      name = 'Standardized streamflow index', 
      low = '#6b473e', mid = 'snow1', high = '#125a0d', 
      na.value = 'white',
      breaks = -3:3,
      limits = c(-3.7, 3.7)) +
    theme(
      panel.background = element_blank(),
      legend.key.width = unit(1, 'cm'),
      legend.key.height = unit(0.3, 'cm'),
      legend.justification = 'left',
      legend.position = legend.position,
      axis.line.x = element_line(),
      axis.text.y = if (!region.text) element_blank(),
      axis.title.y = if (!region.text) element_blank() else element_text(angle = 90),
      axis.ticks.y = element_blank())
}
```

Now let's test this function.

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=4}
# Panel a: full plot
pa <- flow_history(
  ssi.data = ssi2, region.data = regions, 
  start.year = 1200, end.year = 2012,
  legend.position = 'top',
  x.breaks = seq(1200, 2000, 50), 
  x.axis.position = 'top', 
  region.text = TRUE)
pa
```

```{r, fig.width=1, fig.height=4}
# Panel b1: Samalas eruption
pb1 <- flow_history(
  ssi.data = ssi2, region.data = regions, 
  start.year = 1257, end.year = 1259,
  legend.position = 'none',
  x.breaks = 1258, 
  x.axis.position = 'bottom', 
  region.text = TRUE)
pb1
```

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
# Panel b2: Angkor Drought I
pb2 <- flow_history(
  ssi.data = ssi2, region.data = regions, 
  start.year = 1345, end.year = 1375,
  legend.position = 'none',
  x.breaks = seq(1345, 1375, 5), 
  x.axis.position = 'bottom', 
  region.text = FALSE)
pb2
```

Now that the individual panels can be plotted, let's assemble them.

## Assembling plots

There are many packages to assemble plots, perhaps the most common of which are `cowplot` by Claus O. Wilke and `patchwork` by Thomas Lin Pedersen. The two packages work a bit differently. I think the aspect most relevant to our task here is the way the packages scale the width and height of the plots. `cowplot` includes the axes when calculating widths and heights while `patchwork` doesn't. To visualize this difference, let's put panels b1 and b2 together using these two packages. There are 3 years in panel b1 and 21 years in panel b2, so we'll scale them with the ratio 3/31.

```{r, message=FALSE}
# Assemble with cowplot
library(cowplot)
plot_grid(pb1, pb2, rel_widths = c(3, 31))
```
```{r, message=FALSE}
# Assemble with patchwork
library(patchwork)
pb1 + pb2 +
  plot_layout(widths = c(3, 31))
```

Notice what happens to b1. Because `cowplot` counts the y-axis when calculating plot width, and b1 has a wide y-axis and b2 does not, b1 gets squished. `patchwork` only considers the plot body for widths, so this problem does not happen.

Let's now make the rest of panel b and then assemble.

```{r, fig.width=8.5, fig.height=5}
# Panels b3 to b9
pb3 <- flow_history(ssi2, regions, 1401, 1425, x.breaks = seq(1405, 1420, 5),
                    legend.position = 'none', x.axis.position = 'bottom')
pb4 <- flow_history(ssi2, regions, 1452, 1454, x.breaks = 1452,
                    legend.position = 'none', x.axis.position = 'bottom')
pb5 <- flow_history(ssi2, regions, 1638, 1641, x.breaks = 1640,
                    legend.position = 'none', x.axis.position = 'bottom')
pb6 <- flow_history(ssi2, regions, 1756, 1768, x.breaks = c(1760, 1765),
                    legend.position = 'none', x.axis.position = 'bottom')
pb7 <- flow_history(ssi2, regions, 1790, 1796, x.breaks = c(1790, 1795),
                    legend.position = 'none', x.axis.position = 'bottom')
pb8 <- flow_history(ssi2, regions, 1815, 1817, x.breaks = 1815,
                    legend.position = 'none', x.axis.position = 'bottom')
pb9 <- flow_history(ssi2, regions, 1876, 1878, x.breaks = 1877,
                    legend.position = 'none', x.axis.position = 'bottom')
# Panel b together
pb <- pb1 + pb2 + pb3 + pb4 + pb5 + pb6 + pb7 + pb8 + pb9 +
  plot_layout(widths = c(3, 31, 25, 3, 4, 13, 7, 3, 3), nrow = 1)
# Merging panels a and b
pab <- pa + plot_spacer() + pb + 
  plot_layout(ncol = 1, heights = c(1, 0.2, 0.8)) 
pab
```

We have the plot! Now all we need to do is add the annotations.

# Annotating

The horizontal lines at the bottom of panel a is easy to do.

```{r, fig.width=8.5, fig.height=6}
# Starting and ending years of events
segments <- data.table(x    = c(1257, 1345, 1401, 1452, 1638, 1756, 1790, 1815, 1876),
                       xend = c(1258, 1375, 1425, 1453, 1641, 1768, 1796, 1816, 1878))
# Add the segments to panel a
pa <- pa +
  geom_segment(aes(x = x, xend = xend, y = 0.125, yend = 0.125), size = 0.25,
                   data = segments, colour = 'steelblue')
# Update the assembly
pab <- pa + plot_spacer() + pb + 
  plot_layout(ncol = 1, heights = c(1, 0.2, 0.8)) 
pab
```

Drawing the lines connecting the panels was actually more challenging than I thought. The annotations link different panels, and it's rather difficult to determine their relative positions, because each panel has its own coordinate system. Instead, I transformed them into one grid object with one coordinate system, and drew the annotations on this canvas. This was possible thanks to `cowplot`.

```{r}
# Transform the patchwork into a grid object
fhGrob <- patchwork::patchworkGrob(pab)
# Draw tthe grid object as a cowplot object
fhWrap <- cowplot::ggdraw(fhGrob)
```

Now I just need to determine the positions of the lines nad texts. This was relatively easy because I knew the starting and ending years of each event, so I could determine the proportions of the lines. Still, it took some adjusting. Finally, these numbers below work for a 8.5 in x 6 in canvas.

```{r, fig.width=8.5, fig.height=6, out.width="150%"}
yLine <- c(0.3500, 0.4730)
yText <- 0.365
