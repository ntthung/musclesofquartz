Today—thanks to [this](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/367/6484/1314.full) short letter in Science—I discovered that the Chinese have instituted a 10-year ban on all commercial fishing in the Yangtze and its tributaries. This follows the likely extinction of various aquatic species, including the Yangtze river dolphin and, most recently, the Chinese paddlefish. This [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnsslY0GICk) by the South China Morning Post has some footage of one of these monsters being brought aboard a fishing vessel.

The ban started in January this year. It’s a landmark piece of environmental legislation, but it appears to be have been completely overlooked by mainstream western media outlets.
